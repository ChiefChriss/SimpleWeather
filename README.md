# SimpleWeather
A console based weather app
Created using python wanted to test out my abilities to implement a weather api (https://www.weatherapi.com) in python for an upcoming hackathon which might require implementing its api or external. 
#Disclaimer
if you want to use this yourself you have to create an api key with https://www.weatherapi.com 
they have a paid one and a free one.
You also need to have the request library downloaded
